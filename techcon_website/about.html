            <p>
                Since its inception in 2015, TechCon has grown from a small regional meetup into a globally recognized conference. 
                What began as a platform for tech enthusiasts to share ideas has evolved into an annual gathering where industry leaders, 
                startups, and researchers converge to discuss innovation, collaboration, and the future of technology.
